\section{Disclaimer}
This script only covers the first lecture half (week 1-7). It is written to be read while following the lecture. Ideally, go to the lecture to get a broad overview from the professor and then read the chapter about the presented lecture topic in the script.

The script is written to very closely match the lecture contents from FS2023. It focuses on clarifying topics presented in the lecture in an intuitive way and, most importantly, streamlining and clearly connecting all the presented topics with frequent overviews of how certain things relate to previously learned concepts.

Currently, the script is not officially approved by the lecturers and they did not read or verify its contents. If you spot mistakes or notice that there are new contents from the lecture that are not covered in the script, do not hesitate to open a pull request on github (skehrli/ParallelProgrammingScript) or contact the author.
