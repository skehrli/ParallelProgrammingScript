# Parallel Programming Inofficial Course Script
The script only covers the first lecture half (W1-W7). For the second lecture half, the LockOverview.pdf file provides an overview over which lock implementations fulfill which properties, how to prove starvation freedom and fairness and some fairness/starvation-freedom proofs.

The script is written to be read while following the lecture. Ideally, go to the lecture to get a broad overview from the professor and then read the chapter about the presented lecture topic in the script.

The script is written to very closely match the lecture content from FS2023. It focuses on clarifying topics presented in the lecture in an intuitive way and, most importantly, streamlining and clearly connecting all the presented topics with frequent overviews of how certain things relate to previously learned concepts.

## possible future improvements
- add more exercises (for example from exams.vis)
- add kahoot questions from exercises
- write about second lecture part
